# ProsperQi Financial Tracker

## Introduction
ProsperQi is a holistic financial tracker designed to bring balance and prosperity to your personal and professional life. Inspired by the concept of Yin Yang and drawing from East Asian philosophy, ProsperQi aims to promote harmony and positive energy in your financial journey.

## Project Name
The name "ProsperQi" is a combination of two key elements: "Prosper" and "Qi".

### Prosper
The term "Prosper" represents the idea of abundance, success, and flourishing wealth. It reflects our aspiration to help you achieve financial stability and prosperity.

### Qi
"Qi" is a fundamental concept in East Asian cultures, referring to the vital energy that flows through all living things. It represents balance, harmony, and the interconnectedness of opposites. By incorporating "Qi" in our project name, we emphasize the significance of finding balance and positive energy in your financial practices.

### Yin Yang
The concept of Yin Yang plays a central role in ProsperQi. It symbolizes the harmonious interplay of opposing forces, representing the dualities present in personal finances such as income and expenses, saving and spending, and growth and stability. ProsperQi encourages you to embrace the Yin Yang philosophy to achieve financial well-being and harmony.
